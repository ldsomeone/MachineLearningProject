    "<p>The k-nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN) is a supervised machine learning method. It uses proximity to compare one data point with a set of data it was trained on and has memorised to make predictions.\n",
    "In my code below, I aimed to predict whether or not particular cars were acceptable or not. In my code, I used the Euclidean distance which measures a straight line between the query point and the other point being measured.\n",
    "The 'K' hyperparameter defines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions for a new data point. The choice of 'k' can significantly impact the algorithm's performance.I used k=9, as it gave me the best f1 score, and this means that the algorithm will consider the nine nearest neighbors to the query point and make a prediction. This is likely because it provides a balance between a small and large k value, meaning that my algorithm will not be significantly affected by outliers/noise in the data and will also not oversmooth.\n",
