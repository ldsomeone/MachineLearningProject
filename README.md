## Projects

### Github Setup - 5 Points
This is repository is the first part of my machine learning portfolio.
<br> 


### Linear Regression - 5 Points
**Project Name:** Predicting the Damage of Forest Fires
**Description:** This project involves implementing a linear regression model to predict the area that a forest fire wil burn based on the temperature of a given day. The dataset used contains data used to both train and test the model. The results are then plotted on a scatter graph.

<br>

### Classification using K-NN - 5 Points
**Project Name:**  KNN for Classifying Cars
**Description:** This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm to classify cars as either acceptable, unacceptable, good or very good based off a number of input variables. It then prints the results of this in a confusion matrix.

### Neural Networks Essay - 15 Points
**Project Name:** Research Report on Neural Networks.
**Description:** This is an essay that discusses the components of artificial neural networks, different types of neural networks and their applications, and the training of neural networks.  
**Date:** 21/8/24  
**References:**
