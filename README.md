## Projects

### Linear Regression
**Project Name:** [Predicting the Damage of Forest Fires]  
**Description:** This project involves implementing a linear regression model to predict the area that a forest fire wil burn based on the temperature of a given day.. The dataset used contains data used to both train and test the model.  
**Date:** [9/8/24]

### Classification using K-NN
**Project Name:** [Insert Project Name]  
**Description:** This project focuses on implementing the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm for classification tasks. The dataset used is [brief description of dataset], and the primary objective is to maximize the accuracy of the model by tuning hyperparameters and using cross-validation.  
**Date:** [Insert Date]

### Image Recognition
**Project Name:** [Classifying Handwriten Digits.]  
**Description:** This project involves building an image recognition model using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The dataset consists of roughly 2000 handwritten digits (0-9) and the goal is to recognise each digit. To demonstrate this, I print an example image from the set and its corresponding label.
